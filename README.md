## First project : "Boston Housing Price"

This piece is about Boston Housing Price prediction using Linear Regression. 

Goals: 

- Check the essential assumption of linear regression model 
- Study the performance of different models
- Identifying the best linear regression for predicting boston housing price
- Identifying the outliers and high influence points for improving the model performance. 

## Second project : "Classifying Gender of Observations based on the Weight and Height"

This piece is an attempt to classify the gender of observations based on the weight and height using Logistic Regression. 

Goals: 

- Fit the different logistic regression model on training data
- Find the best regularization parameter using cross-validation
- Find the best fitted model with the best regularization parameter. 
- Draw a classifier based on the model. 


## Third project : "Text Classification"

This piece is an attempt to analyze the text using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. 

Goals : 

- Use the vector space model and a search engine 
- Use Naive Bayes model (Multinomial and other likelihood function) 
- Find the best fitted model with the log_likelihood for scoring 
- Predicting the freshness for a new review 
- Use TF-IDF weighting instead of word count to improve the model 
- Try Random Forest algorithm and compare the result with the previous models 

## Fourth Project : "Clustering"
